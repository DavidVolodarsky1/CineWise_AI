# 🎬 CineWise AI Agent

An advanced movie recommendation agent built with **Llama 3.3 (via Groq)** and **TMDB API**, implementing sophisticated AI engineering patterns.

## 🚀 Re-Engineered Features (Post-Feedback Update)
This project was specifically enhanced to demonstrate advanced Agentic behaviors:

- **Chain of Thought (CoT):** The agent performs a deliberate reasoning process before selecting tools or answering.
- **Native Tool Calling:** Replaced hardcoded routing with dynamic LLM tool selection.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Capable of combining data from multiple tools (e.g., finding a director and then searching their specific filmography).
- **Output Verification:** The agent validates tool results against the user's original intent.
- **MCP-Inspired Architecture:** Decoupled logic between the Reasoning Engine (LLM) and the Tool Layer.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **LLM:** Llama 3.3 70B / Llama 3.1 8B (Groq)
- **Framework:** Python, Streamlit (Web UI)
- **Data Source:** TMDB API
- **Protocol:** Inspired by Model Context Protocol (MCP)
